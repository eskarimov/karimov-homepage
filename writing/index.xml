It allows to have an overview of data, presented in the organisation, by storing metadata about it - such as location, format, columns/attributes, etc. This is especially important combined with the modern data teams architectures, such as Data Mesh, when every team can contribute to data catalog.
There&amp;rsquo;s a growing interest in the industry to improve productivity of data engineers and scientists with metadata.</description></item><item><title>Choosing open-source comment system</title><link>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2021-01-11-comments-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2021-01-11-comments-system/</guid><description>During this web-site development I naturally had an idea to add a comment system here. Although Hugo, which I use, supports Disqus out of the box, I&amp;rsquo;m not so happy about it due to quite controversial opinions about it.
So I started to search for alternatives and stopped on Commento - it looks quite lightweight and easy to setup.
So I set all up, added JS/HTML things, and wanted to enjoy - but an issue is apparently appeared when I tried to connect 3-rd party auth providers, particularly Github.</description></item><item><title>Switching to Notion after many years of using Onenote</title><link>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2020-12-16-notion-vs-onenote/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2020-12-16-notion-vs-onenote/</guid><description>OneNote was my primary place for collecting every note for many years. I started to use it long ago, maybe 10 years ago in the times when Windows phones still exist. It suited my needs for many years, but while reading the article about &amp;ldquo;Zettelkasten&amp;rdquo; notes method (highly recommend to have a look!) I found that probably I need to review my tools and try something new allowing to build links between my notes.</description></item><item><title>Some lessons learned working with Spark/AWS Glue</title><link>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2020-11-23-lessons-learned-spark-glue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.karimov.berlin/writing/2020-11-23-lessons-learned-spark-glue/</guid><description>Random general and specific notes from Notion made after a couple of projects working with Spark/AWS Glue:
Parquet format doesn&amp;rsquo;t support empty arrays Schema evolution in Spark 2.4 for ORC format is broken Looking forward for ZSTD compression for ORC format. Always check that desired features work as expected - apparently dynamic partitioning pruning doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in AWS Glue as expected with broadcast join, reading the whole dataset on the left side.</description></item></channel></rss>
