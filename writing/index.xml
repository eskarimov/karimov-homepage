I started to use it long ago, maybe 10 years ago in the times when Windows phones still exist. It suited my needs for many years, but while reading the article about &amp;ldquo;Zettelkasten&amp;rdquo; notes method (highly recommend to have a look!) I found that probably I need to review my tools and try something new allowing to build links between my notes.</description></item><item><title>Some lessons learned working with Spark/AWS Glue</title><link>https://karimov.berlin/writing/2020-11-23-lessons-learned-spark-glue/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://karimov.berlin/writing/2020-11-23-lessons-learned-spark-glue/</guid><description>Random general and specific notes from Notion made after a couple of projects working with Spark/AWS Glue:
Parquet format doesn&amp;rsquo;t support empty arrays Schema evolution in Spark 2.4 for ORC format is broken Looking forward for ZSTD compression for ORC format. Always check that desired features work as expected - apparently dynamic partitioning pruning doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in AWS Glue as expected with broadcast join, reading the whole dataset on the left side.</description></item></channel></rss>
