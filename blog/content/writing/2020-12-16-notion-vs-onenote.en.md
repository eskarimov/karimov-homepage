OneNote was my primary place for collecting every note for many years.
I started to use it long ago, maybe 10 years ago in the times when Windows phones still exist.
It suited my needs for many years, but while reading
[the article about "Zettelkasten"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) notes method
(highly recommend to have a look!) I found
that probably I need to review my tools and try something new allowing to build links between my notes.

So I gave a chance to Notion, especially after it removed a limit on amount of pages for free plan.

Aand... I'd say it works really well for me.
It's very flexible, supporting things from travel and week planning to keeping books/films to watch.
Previously I just made unordered lists, now it's structured tables with several attributes to filter.

For instance, I use [the following template](https://notionpages.com/578/weekly-planning-template/) for my weekly plans
and another custom template for travels planing (but apparently it's not available publicly anymore)

Feel free to leave comments if you're interested that I'd share some examples of my lists/tables/plan structures. 

P.S. I didn't get a cent from Notion for this post ðŸ˜›
