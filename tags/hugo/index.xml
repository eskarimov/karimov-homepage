Although Hugo, which I use, supports Disqus out of the box, I&amp;rsquo;m not so happy about it due to quite controversial opinions about it.
So I started to search for alternatives and stopped on Commento - it looks quite lightweight and easy to setup.
So I set all up, added JS/HTML things, and wanted to enjoy - but an issue is apparently appeared when I tried to connect 3-rd party auth providers, particularly Github.</description></item></channel></rss>
