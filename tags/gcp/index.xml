With this writing, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my first impressions working with them.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with DataPlex first.
Google promotes it as a data fabric, helping to unify distributed data and automate data management by building a domain-oriented data mesh.
The idea seems to be very nice, data might be stored in multiple GCP projects and Dataplex will govern and manage it without any data movement.</description></item></channel></rss>
