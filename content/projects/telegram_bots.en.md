A couple of telegram bots created long ago:

- [Monitor RZD bot](https://t.me/monitorrzdbot) - bot for monitoring seats/tickets availability for RZD (Russian Railways).  
Especially interesting was to practice in creating a calendar as a custom keyboard.  
Another amazing thing - 
some practice with speech recognition, extracting starting and destination points, dates.


- [Event bot](https://t.me/vasyaeventbot) - the idea behind is to allow users create and find/participate in different events close by.  
It was a nice experience to play with Telegram API and practice with Geo data usage.
