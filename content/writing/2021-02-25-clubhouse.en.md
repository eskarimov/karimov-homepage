An application which is not available to everyone helps those, who have it, to make a secret out of
what was democratized and devalued to the limit - own talk-shit.
For this purpose, nothing is written or saved there.
What people kept as the highest value - knowledge - is now in such a wild overproduction that potlatch is needed,
ritual destruction.

Like an avid alcoholic, the golden billion stops for a minute to vomit unnecessary information,
and, wiping its mouth, again lies down at the table, where continues to feed each other.

About 20 years ago someone said: content is not a king; connectivity is a king.
Indeed, the Internet all this time went from the constancy and coherence of information to the chaos of society.

From hypertext and web 1.0, where search engines, thematic sites and forums reigned - through blogs,
organized by time of content creation, not by topic - to social networks, where the hottest discussions and news are 
forgotten in a maximum of two weeks, and posts with third-party links are deliberately de-prioritized 
in the search results (anti-hypertext!) - to the video in which the very ability to search for information and
refer to it is absent - further, further, more and more fractional and ephemeral - vines, coubs, stories, tiktok - and now - 
the disappearance of information right at the moment of its appearance.

A world in which the burning of Library of Alexandria 
(for historical critics - I know it actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries)
was an example of cultural tragedy,
and the burning of books - a synonym for a crime against humanity, is gone.
Basking by the fire of social interactions is so important that it turned out to be possible to heat this stove with its own information.
Entropy.
